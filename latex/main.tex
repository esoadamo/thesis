      Cybersecurity presents significant challenges, particularly for individuals and small organizations that often lack the expertise and resources necessary for effective defense. This gap has led to the emergence of SaaS tailored for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) environments.

      This diploma thesis investigates the relevancy of SaaS solutions for SOHO environments, as offered by major cloud providers. Focusing on various real-life-like scenarios, ranging from individual users to small businesses, the thesis identifies specific cybersecurity requirements and assesses how different SaaS products meet these needs. A comparative analysis methodology is developed to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each solution, providing insights that will assist SOHO users in making informed cybersecurity decisions. This analysis aims to determine which SaaS offerings effectively balance security, cost, and ease of use for diverse SOHO contexts.
