    - Threat protection - anti-mallware & sandboxing & URL filtering .…
    - Compliance - self explaining
- Identity sources:
  - Azure AD tennant - hard to set-up

- [Validate JWTs · Cloudflare Zero Trust docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/validating-json/)
  - name of the cookies, Python code

- [Zero Trust GitLab SSH & HTTP · Cloudflare Zero Trust docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/gitlab/)
  - shows only access protection, not logging in
- can you SAML for NextCloud - requires click on login

  - [SaaS applications · Cloudflare Zero Trust docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/saas-apps)
  - for self-hosted applications two apps must be set-up
    - one as self hosted for access
    - second as SaaS for SAML
- gitea has no SAML yet - https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/5512
  - *to study*: [SAML vs OIDC: What’s the Real Difference? | OneLogin Blog](https://www.onelogin.com/blog/real-difference-saml-oidc)
  - maybe implement custom SAML -> OIDC server?
