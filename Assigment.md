Cybersecurity is a complex problem. Most individuals and small organizations lack knowledge and resources to be able to handle cybersecurity challenges on their own. This problem led to raise of Security-as-a-Service (SaaS) for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO). SaaS for SOHO should bring benefits such as guaranteed level of security, transparent costs and ease of use.  
  
Topic of this diploma thesis is to conduct a comparative analysis of SaaS for SOHO solutions.  
  
The student will do the following:  

- Identify a few SOHO scenarios (e.g., individual user, family with 2 adults and 3 children, small company with 10-20 employees) where SaaS may be considered a solution for addressing cybersecurity requirements. For each scenario, the student will list the expected needs.
- Identify several notable SaaS solutions currently on the market (e.g., O365, Gsuite, CloudFlare).
- Formulate a methodology for comparison of such services with regards to the scenarios.
- Conduct the comparison, identify strong points, weak points, patterns and antipatterns.
