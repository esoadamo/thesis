-  digicomp levels 3 as per expected level per country from [[Digital competence]]/[[@OECDSkillsMatter]]
## Profile description

- 2 parents, 2 children (12 and 8 years old)
- parents have work Windows laptops, children have one shared laptop with shared account set-up from store
- all of them have Android smartphones in under 7k CZK range
- have bought external USB harddrive for photo backup
- neither of them is able to read warning messages - they just click agree if visible
- are scared of cloud because of saying that _"anything uploaded to internet is newer deleted"_
- shared laptop has multiple antiviruses, CCleaner, etc.
- every one of them have Seznam email account and Google account, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram
- have two passwords: one "strong" (= hard to remember) and one for less critical accounts
- family chat on Viber, friends chat on Instagram
- browses internet using Edge on laptop, Chrome on Android
- have bough Microsoft Office 2010 and refuse to upgrade to monthly subscription, because it still just works
- smart TV with kids lock (privacy intrusive OS etc.)
- one WiFi router from ISP with single SSID
## Problems with current approach

- parents are using work laptop for personal agendas
- children share the same account, may cause problems with sessions and logging out
- their smartphones are most likely without newest security updates
- single external USB hard drive is susceptible to fail -- simple drop to ground can destroy it
- their low digital competence may make them vulnerable to phishing and advertising attacks
- using only two passwords implies breach of any one of them will breach multiple accounts
- chat on Viber implies that all messages are lost after on-boarding on a new device unless backup was enabled [[@ViberRestoreChat]]
	- low privacy, FBI can get all the metadata [[@FBIDataMessenger]]
- using different browsers makes it hard to synchronize history and passwords
- using old unsupported Office has serious security implications
- ISP may provide router without security patches
- given their low understanding of technology terms, their TV may record all their conversation
