Cyber-security is a crucial part of everyday life. Be it an individual user with only an email address accessed monthly through a library computer or an international company with thousands of employees, everyone is facing risks. Be it self-inflicted dangers from reckless usage of their own devices, having been selected by automated mass phishing email or password spraying against their online account or being specifically targeted; everyone is still at risk of losing their data or privacy to a malicious actor or for good. Even though most people are aware of these ever-looming threats, only some know about relevant security best practices for data protection and retention, as even once-good advice and lessons learned may have aged with the transition to a more internet-connected environment in the last two decades. With the higher connectivity, new services have arisen, one of the types being security-as-a-services cloud applications that offer to solve the users' cyber-security needs, significantly streamlining their security workflow.

In this thesis, I first compare what advice regarding computer security is available and what a general user may stumble upon their counter-examples in security best practices. As this thesis is being tailored to a broad audience with different skill sets and levels in their IT backgrounds, in the second chapter, I present and quantify what knowledge can be expected by expressing existing publications in a unified international standard. Afterwards, in Chapter 3, I set forth selected profiles demonstrating standard settings of a combination of a person's IT knowledge and their needs, ranging from a family with minimal technical knowledge to a small technology start-up company. Next, in Chapter 4, I explore selected large general security-as-a-service solutions and their capabilities, together with a small set of solutions tailored for a specific task. Finally, in Chapter 5, I showcase the methodology for deciding which solution best fits the needs of the before-mentioned profiles. In Chapter 6, I describe the best possible solutions for each profile in detail.
