In this chapter, I will explore various existing services that can help address the problems outlined in the previous chapter, with preference for those solutions that can effectively solve most of the user needs at once. This chapter contains well-known examples that cover a majority of user requirements, while additionally examining smaller-scale solutions that focus on a specific subset of tasks. Lastly, I will introduce a unique solution that involves self-hosting everything on a Synology NAS device as a control group for the other solutions in later chapters.
## Microsoft

The first large provider of security as a service that we are going to introduce in this thesis is Microsoft. Microsoft's most well-known product is the operating system Windows, which is currently available in its version 10 or 11 dominates the market of desktop OS. Other that that, Microsoft also provides a large spectrum of cloud-based services for both individualita and company-based use.
### Provided cloud services

Microsoft cloud service services, called Microsoft 365, are ranging from its email freemail account to OneDrive cloud storage together with an full-featured browser-based office suite.`TEX:\footnote{Microsoft does provide much larger range of cloud-based services, including cloud computing, but these services are out of scope of this thesis and as such are not included}` Although, the freemail account is not a requirement, as when creating a new Microsoft account, the user may decide if they do want to reuse their existing email account or create a new mail account. In its free version, the user has the capacity of 5 GB for cloud storage and 15 GB for mail storage, if they have chosen to also create a mail account [[@onedrivePricing]].
This storage can be extended to 50 GB or 1 TB in paid plans, the business plans do start with 1 TB shared or 1 TB per employee.

After its creation, the Microsoft account can be used as a single sign-on source for other applications. The accounts can be assigned to groups within Microsoft Azure portal, though this requires more technical knowledge and is better suited for businesses. For companies, Microsoft also provides advanced security features such as data loss prevention for filtering documents and email messages for company-confidential data, or specifying labels assigned to assets together with polices, that can apply encryption to the data and prevent its accidental leakage [[@microsoftApplyEncryption]].
### Family services

First thing in the range of family-related or individual-related services, first of all we may take a look at Microsoft Family Safety application which does connect with children's Android phone, where after installing on children's Android phone, the parents are able to fully take a look at the children's position near them, be notified when children reach certain locations such as school or home, or they can impose limits on how much of applications for which time the child can actually use per day. And there is also a possibility of recording all his strokes to protect the children against cyber-bullying and stuff like that. As the application is installed as an administrator of the device, it has the authority to approve the installation of any application. When using the Microsoft Edge browser on the smartphone, the parent can monitor all visited sites and create a whitelist of allowed sites for the child. These features are also available on desktop.

### Desktop integration

As an operating system from Microsoft, it seamlessly integrates with the company's ecosystem of services, thanks to features like OneDrive and easy integration with other apps. Windows also comes with Microsoft Defender, a reinstalled endpoint malware protection program that effectively scans the system. Additionally, the operating system features Microsoft Smart Screen, which verifies the authenticity of applications before launching them. This security measure ensures that only trusted applications are allowed to run on the computer, unless explicitly disabled or due to a loss of action. For the Microsoft Windows project system, there is an option to have an encrypted drive with BitLocker encryption software. Additionally, there is an online page within your settings on the online portal Microsoft, where you can search for your lost device or get information about your devices connected to your account, including RAM usage, system version, and hot snaps. If you ever forget your BitLocker encryption keys, you can recover them from the set account.

## Google

Google is the next big provider of security as a service. Unlike Microsoft, which has a large portion of the desktop market, Google has large coverage of the smartphone market with its Android OS, which often comes pre-installed with Google applications. Google is also well-known for its web browser, Google Chrome, and its operating system, Chrome OS or Chromebooks. Although Chromebooks do not use the Chrome OS, they are briefly mentioned in this thesis. Google provides various services, including Gmail and Google Drive, a file sharing and backup service that also includes an office suite with home apps for editing documents, creating presentations, or working with spreadsheets. Anyone can create a free Google account to access the individual free plan for Google. Google Drive and Gmail have inbuilt antivirus scans. Because Chrome OS is heavily based on network connectivity and cloud working, there is no need for ransomware protection as everything is backed up by Google.

Google offers various services to back up your Android OS and applications, including WhatsApp and other communication apps. They also offer backing up your data to Google Drive. Google One, or G Suite for Families, is a paid plan available for up to six people, offering a full smart phone backup and advanced photo editing software. The storage capacity varies depending on the tier selected, with 100 gigabytes or two terabytes for 80 crowns a month. Google Expert is also included, which can help with recovering deleted files. However, the VPN service is not available in Czechia and is being shut down. Google Family Link is similar to Microsoft Family Safety, offering child account creation and similar tools to restrict web browsing and location tracking. If you install Chrome on your desktop and sign in with a child's account, you also get content filtering and sign in with a child's account.

## Apple

The next system I would consider for this thesis as one of the providers of a security service, I would name the Echo ecosystem. Even though this ecosystem is slightly close to Apple produced devices, it still, if you are within this contained ecosystem with your device, can provide a wide range of security services, namely, one of the most prominent features of this ecosystem is the synchronization of everything across all of your devices, which is actually backed up by the cloud storage software iCloud. The iCloud has one ability that neither Microsoft nor Google Drive possesses and that is that it is actually end-to-end encrypted, even though the key can be recovered by Apple, if not specifically set otherwise. Next, Apple Echo system can provide you with a new email on iCloud.com domain, if you choose to create a new account and the Apple devices like iPhone do actually have enabled a full backup by default, meaning that if you want to use your device or something like that, you can recover the full content of the device just by logging into your Apple account and downloading everything on a new device. The downside to this is that even though you have a full backup of your phone, this actually takes a lot of space on your iCloud drive, where you get only 5GB of memory for free and you have to pay to get more memory with a monthly subscription, which I'll include prices in the version text. Moving on, the Apple does also provide a method for storing passwords, so called Apple Key Vault, which is able and enabled by default to store all your login credentials, and again synchronize with entry and entry encryption. Next, the Apple Echo system comes with an inbuilt Find My Device feature for locating your device. And to do, does it have something for family? I don't know, I need to find out.

## Synology

As the control group, we can include Synology network storage, which is a standalone device that you can purchase for a few thousand crowns when both first-hands or near two thousand crowns when both form a second hand. Even though this device is primarily supposed to be used for storing files, it does actually come with a large plug-in system and the main advantage of Synology is that it actually provide a convenient bridge between using a cloud-based solution and by self-hosting everything yourself, as it does come with very convenient GUI for configuration, which even intermittently or late-beginner users should be able to configure to their needs. This GUI is web-based and after creating a main account, you are able to download more plugins, which include Thunder server, Contacts server, and many more, and one of the main advantages is that on your devices, you have the ability to run self-hosted Docker container, which means that you are able to run pretty much everything. Under the hood, the newer Synology systems do actually use ETRFS by default, meaning that you get support for checksum files to watch for corruption and use your hard drives and software write to have multiple hard drives connected into one for larger storage. A very important feature of Synology is that it is possible to configure something called Synology Quick Connect to be able to access your Synology device remotely, as it does actually This Quick Connect is for up to 250 users and 10 devices, and as you can see, if you configure this yourself, you are able to achieve a self-hosted solution with the obvious downside being the obvious upside of this solution is that you get a solution that you pay only once for, and you get running forever, with the obvious disadvantage of decreased physical security of your data and having to somewhat manage the server itself. Another disadvantage may be that the Synology devices do actually reach the end of their lifetime, and after the EOL, no more security updates may be published, which may actually put your data at high risk if you do not invest into a newer device, even though the old one is still functioning pretty well. Furthermore, Synology does actually provide anti-virus scan for stored files and nice client for full disk backup of your Windows operating system. Another module that Synology provides is a single sign-on server, where you can actually use your configured Synology users as a program source of truth to work into other applications.

## Proton

The next solution that I would like to propose is the Proton ecosystem, which is a Swiss-based company that advertises their approach to your privacy as their main factor, their main services to include ProtonMail and ProtonDrive and ProtonVPN, but yeah. Proton does offer you with creation of a free account for testing purposes, where you get a 5GB limit shared between your mail and your drive, and here you can test that everything what you saw on your Proton account should be end-to-end encrypted, meaning that all of your emails that are being stored are either really end-to-end encrypted when sent between two ProtonMail users or when the non-ProtonMail party does take its time and configures its open, its PGP keys correctly, or they are encrypted when as soon as received by the ProtonMail server and stored only in an encrypted form. Then goes for ProtonDrive, which offers end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service, which is very similar to the other cloud storage services mentioned beforehand, like Google Drive, OneDrive, with the exception that ProtonDrive does not have currently any option to modify the documents or online office suite, so you do have to download your files first before I print them, which takes away some of the convenience. Next, all the ProtonMail features is their ProtonClender, which is end-to-end encrypted cloud-opt capable calendar, and ProtonGroundX, which is a very similar to the other cloud storage features, which is end-to-end encrypted cloud-opt capable calendar, and ProtonGroundX, which is exactly what the name suggests, and also ProtonPass, which is a password manager. Another service from Proton is their VPN service called ProtonVPN, where again, if you have only a free account, you are able to use only a small set of their VPN servers, but if you upgrade to a paid account, you get access to a full range of all servers. Another advantage of a paid Proton account is their ability to craft self-host and SMTP slash map server, which translates the end-to-end encrypted emails into a classical SMTP or IMAP server that your mail client can understand without any special modifications.
## Crypt pad

## Considered solutions

Of course, when staying in only the cloud storage services, we can have many more examples, for example, Dropbox or Box, but these do not include more than only this service. So, we will consider them out of scope for this thesis, even though mega.nz does actually state that it provides end-to-end encrypted storage system. Given that its own founder has said that nobody should actually trust this encryption system, we will stay away also from this software implementation.

## Bitwarden

On the other hand, when looking on services that do provide actually on this scope, we can take a look at Bitmorton Password Manager, which is an open-source password manager that allows anyone to synchronize their passwords with support of all the systems, including automatic filling. So, it has an enterprise version, which includes more features or even a Kite system, where it includes features like generating TOTP codes on the line and sharing, which would be useful for the firm and family to use.
