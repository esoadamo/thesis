In this thesis, I have identified four user archetypes -- low-tech skilled family, low-tech skilled university student, individual tech-skilled user, andÂ small technology company start-up -- that I have put in context with current publications and the Digital Competence framework. Next, I have formulated a supposed workflow for all the profiles based on personal experience, questionnaires and in-person discussions. This supposed workflow focuses on security workflow, privacy, and data retention. After the workflow is formulated for every profile, I describe patterns and anti-patterns that can be found inside it and the possible consequences.

After profiles were defined, together with problems in their approaches and needs that should be resolved, I have presented a range of security-as-a-service products that either cover a broad spectrum of user needs -- Google, Microsoft, Apple, Proton -- or are specialized in solving a specific area -- Cloudflare for hosting web services, Bitwarden for storing passwords, BackBlaze for data backup, CryptPad for an end-to-end encrypted web-based office suite next, as some of the solutions are not available for free or are more complex to set-up, for every profile I have also analyzed and described in detail how their needs and problems could be solved by attempting to self-host services with Synology NAS device.

To formulate which services solve the needs and problems of the profiles to the highest degree, I have formulated a methodology that can use a point system that awards the most points to the services that fit specific criteria concerning the profiles. In the last chapter, I have described the solutions with most points in detail, together with the solution by trying to self-host everything on a Synology NAS.
